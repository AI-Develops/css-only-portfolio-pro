# CSS-Only Developer Portfolio Generator

This project utilizes the **Webdeveloper-AI** (powered by Gemini 3 Flash) 
to create elegant, lightning-fast portfolios that require zero JavaScript. 
By leveraging modern CSS and Heroicons, you get a highly performant 
site that scores 100/100 on Lighthouse.

## Features
- **Zero JS:** No scripts, no tracking, just pure performance.
- **Heroicons:** Integrated SVG icons for a crisp, professional look.
- **Modern CSS:** Built with CSS Grid, Flexbox, and CSS Variables.
- **Dark Mode Ready:** Includes a CSS-only theme toggle using the 
  checkbox trick.

## How to Use
1. Open the `Prompt.md` file and copy the system instructions.
2. Provide the AI with your personal details (Name, Bio, Projects).
3. Copy the generated HTML and CSS into your project directory.
